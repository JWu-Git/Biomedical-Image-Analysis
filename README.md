# Biomedical-Image-Analysis

This is an image filter pipeline that takes as 2 MRI files, one reference and one to to be altered. 

The image will 

1. be cleaned of high frequency noise with CurvatureAnisotropicDiffusionImageFilter

2. will be cleaned of low frequency noise from the MRI machine through using the N3/N4 filter

3. will have its pixel intensity histogram matched to that of the refence image's using the HistogramMatchingImageFilterType
